YUI3 Form CSS:

* [Tilo's Draft combined docs](http://tilomitra.github.com/cssforms/)

PhoneGap options:

* [config.xml](http://build.phonegap.com/docs/config-xml)

Fonts as icons:

* [The Nown Project](http://thenounproject.com/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)

Need to look up approaches to rendering an analog clock face. Need
to rewrite htdocs/js/rclock.js as a YUI module which can display
either a digital or analog clock face.
